## [1.0.0] - 2023-02-21

Below is just mostly a concise and reorganized Git dump since we started developing Hibiscus in May 2022 (to which we never kept a changelog). We will start adding better changelogs from now on for everyone to have better oversight of every changes to Hibiscus.

Per 1.0.0, this is what we actually used in HackSC 2023, which includes:

1. Hacker (battlepass) / application portal (+ Hackform which was used to collect hacker apps)
2. Sponsor portal
3. Identity portal (fmr. known as volunteer portal, used to check people in via RFID wristbands)
4. HackSC SSO
